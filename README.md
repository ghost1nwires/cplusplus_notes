Here is my humbling repo on learning basic of C++ that I take for granted during my degree life. I shoild have learning with all my heart for this subjects. But I dont have encouragement to stay grinding and learning with all of my heart. Puely, just reading Lectures' note without exploring the basics - advanced of C++. 

So, yeah. I just started it all agan.

Hoping I can finish this before 2025 ends and learning new languages. :man_cook:
