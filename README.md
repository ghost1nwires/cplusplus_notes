Here is my humbling repo on learning basic of C++ that I take for granted during my degree life. I should have learning with all my heart for this subject. But I dont have encouragement to stay grinding and learning with all of my heart. Purely, just reading Lectures' note without exploring the basics - advanced of C++. 

I have started this repo on Oct 2023 (but I mistakenly delete my gitignore file that could have been my git history for this repo :sad:) but then I came back to continue my humbling dev journey in C++ on late October 2025. 

So, yeah. I just started it all agan.

Hoping I can finish this before 2025 ends and learning new languages. :man_cook:

I dont know who's reading this but I just wanna write it here :)
